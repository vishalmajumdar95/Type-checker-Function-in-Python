# Type-checker-Function-in-Python

This is simple type function based on Error Handling in Python. I have just added few lines of code to find type of any data without using any inbuilt function.

## Requirements

### A Text Editor
We need a text editor to edit the type_of.py file and enter the data in file only to check it's type.

After editing the file type_of.py, we can run this code in Linux terminal to get output `python3 type_of.py`
